# Adaptive Façade Design: Interactive Music Pavilion

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Adaptive Façade Design**, aims to create an interactive music pavilion that merges the worlds of AI, music, and architecture. The goal is to enhance sensory experiences in public spaces by generating real-time music from user prompts and synchronizing this music with the movement of architectural elements on the pavilion facade.

## Features

- **Integration of AI and Music**: Utilizes AI algorithms to generate real-time music based on user input.
- **Architectural Synchronization**: Movement of architectural elements on the pavilion facade is synchronized with the generated music.
- **Parametric Design**: Utilizes Rhino and Grasshopper for the parametric design of the pavilion's waffle structure.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Grasshopper and Firefly components are used to analyze the generated music and control the architectural elements accordingly.
- **Prototype Development**: A working prototype is built using various technologies including Arduino programming, 3D printing, and milling.

## Technologies Used

- **Rhino and Grasshopper**: For the parametric design of the pavilion's waffle structure.
- **Leap AI APIs**: Implemented using Python to generate music from user prompts.
- **Grasshopper and Firefly**: For real-time analysis of the generated music.
- **Arduino**: Firefly fermata script for programming Arduino and controlling servo motors for the rotation of panels.
- **Bamboo Lab 3D Printing**: For creating the designed joints.
- **Milling Machine**: For wood carving and embedding the electronics.
